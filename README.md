# LilyUI

LilyUI is a component library for [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

This library is meant to provide set of styled components to easily create UIs for Lilydev projects and other projects by Jade.

This README will get better over time, as there are only a few components at the moment.  
Additionally, this is my first NPM package so code may be a bit messy. Feel free to offer any critiques!
